[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/vim-plugins-profiler)](https://pypi.org/project/vim-plugins-profiler/)

[vim-plugins-profiler](https://github.com/bulletmark/vim-plugins-profiler)
is a small utility which outputs a sorted list of [vim
editor](http://www.vim.org) plugin startup times in millisec. Only vim
plugins you have installed personally in your home directory are
considered. This utility was written for Linux platforms but should work
on other platforms as well, including Mac and Windows.

The latest version and documentation is available at
https://github.com/bulletmark/vim-plugins-profiler.

Just run at command line, e.g.:
```
$ vim-plugins-profiler
   1:    16.759 (54.4%) nerdtree
   2:     4.248 (13.8%) vim-airline
   3:     2.880 ( 9.3%) delimitMate
   4:     2.000 ( 6.5%) tabular
   5:     1.596 ( 5.2%) emmet-vim
   6:     1.579 ( 5.1%) YouCompleteMe
   7:     0.668 ( 2.2%) ctrlp.vim
   8:     0.399 ( 1.3%) vim-surround
   9:     0.271 ( 0.9%) vim-better-whitespace
  10:     0.155 ( 0.5%) vim-commentary
  11:     0.141 ( 0.5%) autoload_cscope.vim
  12:     0.080 ( 0.3%) ag.vim
  13:     0.034 ( 0.1%) vim-javascript
  14:     0.015 ( 0.0%) typescript-vim
  15:     0.010 ( 0.0%) vim-vue
```

- The plugin startup times are in millisec, sorted from highest usage to
  lowest.
- The percentages are the percent of total plugin startup time
  (i.e. the total plugin time additional to normal vim startup time)
  that each plugin contributes.

You should also be able to use it with [neovim](https://neovim.io/):

```
$ vim-plugins-profiler -e nvim
```
